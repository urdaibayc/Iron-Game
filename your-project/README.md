## Project Description
Project description:

I’m a board game lover so when I read we should make a game I started looking through my collection to figure out which to replicate. I made up my mind to replicate Stratego using Pygame.
The idea behind developing Stratego was that the game mechanics are fairly simple: pieces move vertically or horizontally one square at a time inside a square grid. Two pieces can’t occupy the same position at a time unless it’s an attack. The result of an attack is: the higher value piece remains on the bord and the other one is removed.
I also wanted to work with classes since I had brushes with them while following some code alongs, tutorials and what not but I didn’t quite understood how to use them. I had heard of pygame before and since we had to make a game I had to use it.

## Workflow
Most my workflow was structured the following way:

Research projects with similar features.
Research documentation.
Study the code.
Extract from the researched projects the features code I wanted.
Figured out it didn't work.

get conscious of time.
Refactor code.                                                     
Figured out it didn't work.
